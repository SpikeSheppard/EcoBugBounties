# Eco Bug Bounties
Players who have backed Eco at the Developer Tier level (available <a href="https://ecoauth.strangeloopgames.com/home">here</a>) are invited to take on bugs in the Bug Bounty list! Fixing a bug and having the pull request accepted yields the following rewards:

- You'll earn a bounty points as specified in the bug. 
- Every five bounty points you get an Eco key to do with as you like.
- Fixing bounties will earn you a special icon in the game, and your bounty points will be displayed in chat.
- After every 50 bounty points are fixed, we will give out $1000, divided based on points earned since the last payout, payable via PayPal (must supply relevant tax forms before accepting payment).

With dev tier access comes access to the full source code for Eco, the ability to chat to the team on Slack, and access to the developer forums.  Bounty points can be divided among other parties if you want to collaborate with people (determined by whoever submits the Pull Request) and tracked here on GitHub. 

Happy hunting! Join us on the forums or Slack if you have any questions.
